<h1>FFXIV Custom Plugin Repository</h1>

<b>This repository is for testing! You should just install the released plugin you want to use from the official list in-game.</b>

<p>The plugins in this repo are in their pre-testing state. They are subject to rapid changes and all kinds of errors, including game crashes. If you are here to help me test these plugins before release into Dalamud testing, continue reading.</p>

<p>To access the plugins in this repo, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Open the Dalamud settings menu in game.</li>
<li>Choose the <i>Experimental</i> tab.</li>
<li>In the <i>Custom Plugin Repositories</i> section, add <b>https://markjsosnowski.github.io/FFXIV/plugin_repo.json</b> to the list.</li>
<li>Save. You may have to restart your game to see the plugins added to the list.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>If you encounter any issues with these testing plugins, please report them so I can get it fixed before release.</p>
<p>Once/If the plugin is accepted into the offical Dalamud repo, you should uninstall the custom version and add the release version.</p>
